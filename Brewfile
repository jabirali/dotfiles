# Homebrew package list. These are intended to be installed on *all* my
# machines, so I only list the packages that I *really* need everywhere.
# Packages I only need on some computers are instead installed manually.
#
# Examples: the macOS base system `python` and `git` are sufficient for casual
# home use, so I don't list these. But I struggle to use a computer without
# Alfred and iTerm2, my workflow depends heavily on `fish` and `nvim`,
# and my backup system really requires Arq and `lzip` to function.
