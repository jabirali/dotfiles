# Homebrew package list. These are intended to be installed on *all* my
# machines, so I only list the packages that I *really* need everywhere.
# Packages I only need on some computers are instead installed manually.
#
# Examples: the macOS base system `python` and `git` are sufficient for
# casual home use, so these are not here. However, I struggle to use macs
# without Alfred and iTerm2, my workflow across platforms depends on `fish`
# and `nvim`, and my backup system does require Arq and `lzip` everywhere.
