# Dotfiles
This repository contains my Linux config files. Nearly all programs I use
support the XDG specification, so e.g. GNU `stow` is overkill for my use.
Instead, I just clone this repository to `~/.config`, and have an install
script in `bin` that link the remaining couple of files to the right place.

Note that the most interesting parts of my config files have been exported to
separate plugins for Tmux, Fish, and Neovim. Most are hosted on [my GitHub][1].
