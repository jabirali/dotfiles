;; Reasons to NOT use Emacs as my editor:
;; 
;; - Emacs is too addictive. I tend to get stuck for hours playing with Elisp
;;   and Org-mode instead of actually working (numerical code, papers, etc).
;; - Emacs is too exhausting. I get sucked into spending inordinate amounts of
;;   time reading e.g. /r/emacs, which is interesting but takes a mental toll.
;; - Emacs is incompatible. I can't resist choosing e.g. Org-mode over
;;   MarkDown for writing, Elisp over shell scripts for automations, etc.
;;   This makes switches to/from Emacs more expensive than for other editors.
;; - Emacs is rough. I have to "fix" e.g. smooth scrolling, spell checking,
;;   keybindings, snippets, etc. that often "just work" in other editors.
;; - I can't use Emacs in moderation. I've tried to use it e.g. "only for
;;   Org-mode", but once it's installed it always takes over everything.
;; - There's no perfect setup. Maintaining an Evil-based config is a huge time
;;   sink. Doom Emacs is too slow on MacOS (high input latency + stuttering)
;;   and randomly breaks on upgrades. Vanilla keybindings hurt my hands.
;;
;; Overall, it's just not worth the required sacrifice of time and energy.
